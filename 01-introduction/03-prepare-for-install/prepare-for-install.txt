Prepare For Install
-------------------
- Requirements for Linux will vary based upon a number of different factors
    - Linux distribution to use
        - Each distro have different recommendations & baseline requirements
    
    - Hardware compatibility
        - Dependent on the chosen Linux distro to install & use
        - Dependent on the category of the system being built
            - Each system have different components to meet its operational needs

    - Intended system function
        - Identify the intended function of the Linux system being built
        - Each function has its own requirements that needs to be met to operate properly 


- Before installation, plan an appropriate partitioning strategy for the hard drive
    - Servers have different storage needs than individual workstations

    - If the root of the filesystem gets filled up, the system is likely to crash

    - User home directories and log files can unexpectedly increase in size rapidly
        - Isolating these directories to their own partitions can prevent a server crash


- Linux uses a dedicated partition for virtual memory storage called the "swap space"
    - It is important to plan the swap partition 
    
    - General guideline for swap space
        - It should be twice the size of the installed RAM 
        - e.g. 16GB of RAM = 32GB of swap space


- Prepare the filesystem for storing the Linux software
    - At least have 1 (one) filesystem known as the root file system

    - NOTE: Storing all files under the root file system under 1 (one) partition
        - If the filesystem becomes damage, all of the files will be lost in one fell swoop

        - This is a good reason for partitioning out things
            - Into multiple filesystems and multiple partitions

- Allocate more than 1 (one) filesystem and partitions


- Backup all of the filesystems and partitions on a regular basis


- Before purchasing any hardware component
    - Check the compatibility with the relevant Linux distribution
        - Specifically the HCL (Hardware Compatibility List)
        - It stores all hardware devices that a distro supports in some capacity
        - Each distro maintain its own HCL online

    - NOT all hardware will work on every Linux system

    - Storage system
        - Check how many devices can be installed
        - Supported technology interface, controller and capacity
    
    - CPU
        - Check the server desktop market
        - Check the clockrate, cache size and hyper-threading support

    - Memory
        - Check how much RAM is installed on the system
        - Supported DDR SD-RAM generation

    - Network card
        - Know the maximum bandwidth and network technologies it supports
        - e.g. Ethernet, Wi-Fi or more
        - Common source of problem
            - Most network cards rely on Windows OS system drivers to function

    - Input devices
        - Check the mouse, keyboard and USB support

    - Monitors
        - Check connection interface it supports
        - Check refresh rate range and maximum supported pixel resolution
        - Without a supported driver = lower resolution

    - Display adapter
        - Know the chipset, video RAM & connection interfaces integrated into the CPU
        - Determine if it is using a integrated chipset or discrete video card
        - Need to find the appropriate graphical drivers


- Different boot methods in installing Linux
    - Removable media
        - CD, DVD or USB thumb drive
         
    - ISO
        - Install from a local drive where the distro ISO file is downloaded 
        - Popular method for installing on a virtual machine

    - PXE and NFS
        - Boot from installation media over the network (PXE)
            - Requires to have a file server that on the network
            - Grabs the installation files from the file server to install  to the local workstation


- Consider the following factors PRIOR to installing Linux
    - Cost
    - System role
    - Linux distribution 
    - Partition strategies
    - Verify that the hardware is supported in the Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)

    - Doing so help prevent a lot of issues down the road
        - Minimize troubleshooting
